# Tutorial
1. Download the tool

2. Open the .exe file and go to File and click `Open Folder`

3. Select the folder where you installed Jet Set Radio and select the data folder (for steam: steam directory (`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam`) `\steamapps\common\Jet Set Radio\DATA\JETRADIO`)

4. Select `E_GRF.AFS` of the found AFS Archives, no idea why there are multiple, but select `E_GRF.AFS` for testing (Make sure to make a backup of the file before!)

5. Select the Graffiti File you want to edit, and click import and import your image, note: since beta 2, the tool offers a resizing option, to make the best images, make sure to use 512x128 for extra large, 256x128 for large and 128x128 for small.

6. Navigate to File again, and click `Save File` (the archive does **not** get saved when you import a new image, so you have to save this way).
